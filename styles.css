/*selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class
element name - h1,p,title,body. # for id. . for class ) */
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

#para1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }

  .center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }

  /*In this example only <p> elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: */ 

p.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

/*The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.the CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page:*/

* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}


/*In this example we have grouped the selectors from the code above:*/

h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
/*Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)*/

/*text  colour in css*/
body {
  color: green;
}

h1 {
  color: green;
}

/* The CSS Box Model
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

Explanation of the different parts:

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.*/

/*display 
The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout.

/*flex

/*padding
Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
